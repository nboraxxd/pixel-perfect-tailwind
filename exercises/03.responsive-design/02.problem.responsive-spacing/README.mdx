# Responsive Spacing

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/pixel-perfect-figma-to-tailwind/responsive-design/spacing-around-and-between-elements" />

👨‍💼 Look at the `sm`, `md` and `lg` screen sizes in the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1), paying close attention to the **spacing between and around** elements, as well as the logo tiles size.

🐨 Implement those breakpoint changes throughout the design.

💰 Make sure you use Figma's [📜 Dev Mode](https://www.figma.com/dev-mode/) and hover over all the things for maximum accuracy!

💰 To help a bit, I've put a little 👀 emoji before every element that needs change.
