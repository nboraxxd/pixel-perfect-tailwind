👨‍💼 With the small and subtle spacing and typography adjustments behind us, we're going to tackle the big layout change happening at the XL breakpoint.

🐨 At the xl breakpoint, make the grid have 2 columns.

- The first column's width should be defined by the logo grid ([📜 auto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width#auto) sizing)
- The second column should take up the remaining space ([📜 fraction unit](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout#the_fr_unit) sizing).

💰 You can use a `grid-cols-[]` arbitrary value to achieve this!

👨‍💼 Make sure the gap between the columns matches the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/P7JAJ2NX6SOw72iTa8eyjl/Pixel-Perfect-Tailwind?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=WVR4uy4alsTwrVTc-1).
